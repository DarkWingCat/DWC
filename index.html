        <p>Welcome to my little webpage. I will post various projects here. Currently there isn't a lot, but I'm working on it. Currently you can checkout flash versions of the games Snake and Brick, programmed by me using ActionScript 3, FlashDevelop and Ruffle. Some assets have yet to be updated and are currently used as placeholders.</p>
