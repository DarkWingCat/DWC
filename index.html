        <p>Welcome to my little webpage. I will post various projects here. Currently there isn't a lot, but I'm working on it. Currently you can checkout flash versions of the games Snake and Brick, programmed by me using ActionScript 3, FlashDevelop and Ruffle. Some assets have yet to be updated and are currently used as placeholders.</p>

        <h2>Why make such a thing?</h2>
        <p>
            At first glance it might seem odd to make a page dedicated about a technology that’s essentially dead. Though this exact thought is what pushed me to make it: Is it really dead? You’d be surprised to know that Flash and ActionScript never really died. For it is Flash Player that was discontinued.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though less common, there is an entirely separate runtime for ActionScript and Flash content named Adobe AIR. Unlike Flash Player, it is still actively maintained and gets regular updates. The only difference is that it’s a desktop environment, unlike Flash Player which runs in the browser. Still though, it means you have an entirely separate, and very much viable, method of distribution, which peaked my interest enough, to where I took the time to learn ActionScript 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point, I had made my first project and thought to myself: Ruffle works tremendously, even for very complicated things, like proper video games or tools. Why not try it out? And so I did. The games you can play on this website run on Ruffle, have been programmed using FlashDevelop, the AIR SDK and the Flex SDK. It works very well and, in my opinion, goes to show how useful this language can still be. Because while you could have made these things in JavaScript, the ease of programming cannot be understated.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is to say: If you want to try out something different and potentially want to find out whether programming in ActionScript really is as easy as I make it out, I urge you to try it out yourself. It’s free and even if you don’t like it, you’ll have learned something along the way.

                Brick:
            </h2>
            <p>
                I have finished my second Flash game, called Brick. It is more or less a Breakout clone. It works very well, this time even on mobile devices! Using AIR, one could package this as an iOS and Android application, which I might try in the future.
                <br>
                Why not try it out? Use the link at the top of the web page to give it a shot! How far can you get? How many screens can you clear?

                I am aware, that the collision could use some work. Currently it only flips the vertical momentum. That works for most cases, but if the ball hits a brick from the side, it may clip into it. It could also clip into thing or even go through them, if the speed it too high, which is something I will get around to soon.

                Snake:
            </h2>
            <p>
                This technically isn’t my first Flash game, however, it is the first I am happy with. This is just a basic recreation of Snake. Given my current limitations, mostly FlashDevelop, I opted for simple graphics, but with a certain attitude. While FlashDevelop is a powerful tool, it doesn’t have built in support for creating graphics. This led me to using just blocks and shapes. Nevertheless, I still applied various techniques and filters to make it unique.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything besides the background is drawn programmatically using sprites, shapes and other display objects. Try it out and see how many apples you can eat!

                Notes:
            </p>
            <p>
                While the game is almost glitch free, currently there is still one bug: The game originally ran too fast. To counteract this, I implemented a delay: It could only process the game loop every 2nd frame. This works well for slowing the game down from 30fps to 15fps, while keeping the menu and inputs smooth, however, it introduces a problem where you can run into yourself: Normally if you try to run into yourself, you can’t- say you’re going up and press down, nothing happens. Given that inputs are processed every frame though and movement only every second, it can happen that you press two buttons too quickly, because you’re basically doing it in-between frames.
            </p>
            <p>
                This happens because the block, that is preventing you from running into yourself via a button press, is tied to a variable that stores where the snake is going, not the input in relation to the snake’s position. This is something I intend to fix.
